    <h1>Mildly Amusing</h1>
    <h3>by Natasha Perales</h3>
    <p>There's soooo many funny videos out there especially with all the short
    videos like Shorts (YouTube), Reels (IG) and TikToks. While we're only
    supposed to do 3, if you have the time and are interested I included a few
    extras since there's so many from my "Liked Videos" to choose from. Plus
    they might brighten your day or put a smile on your face. :) </p>

    <h2>An Old Classic</h2>
    <p>I remember first seeing this video in 8th grade I believe. I
    don't even remmeber what the project was really, but my group of
    friends were focusing on comedy. My best friend at the time knew
    of this video I think, or we found it when researching. I remember
    being fooled for the first small bit before catching on, but thoroughly
    enjoying the video!! I have since shown it to numerous friends over the
    years and hope you enjoy it if you haven't already seen it.</p>

    <h2>Short & Funny</h2>
    <p>Another short video a good friend from middle school/high school
    showed me that can make you smile.</p>

    <h2>You Just Gotta Smile</h2>
    <p>I feel like this one will put at least a small smile on nearly
    everyone's face. It's funny, adorable, and heartwarming.</p>
