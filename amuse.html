      <h1 class="title">Mildly Amusing</h1>
      <h3>by Natasha Perales</h3>
      <p>There's soooo many funny videos out there especially with all the short videos like Shorts (YouTube), Reels (IG) and TikToks. While we're only supposed to do 3, if you have the time and are interested I included a few extras since there's so many from my "Liked Videos" to choose from. Plus they might brighten your day or put a smile on your face. :) </p>

      <h2>An Old Classic</h2>
        <p>I remember first seeing this video in 8th grade I believe. I don't even remmeber what the project was really, but my group of friends were focusing on comedy. My best friend at the time knew of this video I think, or we found it when researching. I remember being fooled for the first small bit before catching on, but thoroughly enjoying the video!! I have since shown it to numerous friends over the years and hope you enjoy it if you haven't already seen it. <br><br>
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZ5vspsNS1g">Who's on First - Abbott & Costello</a></p>
      
      <h2>Short & Funny</h2>
        <p>Another short video a good friend from middle school/high school showed me that can make you smile. <br><br>
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watchv=OfPKXGf69zA&list=LL&index=251">Ellen's 7-Second Mood Booster</a></p>
     
      <h2>You Just Gotta Smile</h2>
        <p>I feel like this one will put at least a small smile on nearly everyone's face. It's funny, adorable, and heartwarming. <br><br>
