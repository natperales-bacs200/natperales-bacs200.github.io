        <h2>What I love about my mom.....</h2>
        <p>My mom has always been one of my greatest supporters and she inspires me with the way she goes about life. I may
            not have been able to notice it much when I was younger, but my mom handles life so well, and is often always willing
            to do things for us. I hardly see her have a terrible day, even though I know that she does. Even if she does discuss 
            some of her hard days with us, she also still works hard and does all these things for us. She encourages us and teaches
            us in many different ways. She's so wise and hard working. I hope to appear to have a handle on things as well as her one day
            even if she doesn't always feel the same way herself. She at least appears to do it well, and is a strong, kind person.
