      My name is Natasha Perales, and I am currently a senior here
    at UNC. I'm getting my bachelor's in Graphic Desing, but I am not planning on graduating this upcoming spring though, as I 
    am currently taking classes (such as this one) to add on a minor in Digital Marketing.

      I am on the Cross Country and Track & Field team for UNC. I've been running since I was
    twelve years old. It's a love-hate relationship but ultimately I love the opportunites it has
    provided me and the person it's made me grow into as a result. Some of the best friendships I've had
    and experiences with people have come from my teammates and being a part of the team.
